//  # LIDAR-Lite v2: If second return availble, show instead of strongest signal
//
//  This example will demostrate how to disable showing strongest signal return and
//  print the second return if one is availble. This kind of approach can help with
//  window and chain link fence detection situation (amungst others).
//
//  The library is in BETA, so subscribe to the github repo to recieve updates, or just check in periodically

//  To learn more read over lidarlite.cpp as each function is commented
